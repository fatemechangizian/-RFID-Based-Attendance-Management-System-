# -RFID-Based-Attendance-Management-System-
This project is based on the idea of using RFID cards in various application, which are used in this project for the attendance management system. This system is easy to use and it has wide range of application in all companies, banks, factories, and even educational institutions such as universities.
The purpose of the project is to design and implement an attendance system with its executable software (LabVIEW) based on RFID technology. The serial module of LabVIEW receives data sent by the processor. After receiving the data serially, LabVIEW access the already present data in the database and converts them into LabVIEW compatible formats. Then check if the data received at the USB terminal matches with any of the present data (Database). If match then the database is updated to the new value. If unsuccessful then LabVIEW simply does not change the database.
